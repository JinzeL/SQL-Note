### Notes
1. Thinking about when should use 'DISTICT' in SELECT satement
2. `SELECT () AS ...` Should be used one more time outsied the main SELECT when 'null' is needed to output
3. Set Method
4. Window Fuction - [link](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-window-functions/)
    ```
   window_function_name(expression) OVER ( 
   [partition_defintion]
   [order_definition]
   [frame_definition]
   )
   ```

*window_function_name:*

- `RANK()` would give the identical rows a rank of 2, then skip ranks 3 and 4, so the next result would be 5
- `DENSE_RANK()` would still give all the identical rows a rank of 2, but the following row would be 3—no ranks would be skipped.
- `NTILE(*# of buckets*)` : NTILE(4) quartile, NTILE(100) percentile
- `LAG/LEAD()` : LAG or LEAD to create columns that pull values from other rows—all you need to do is enter which column to pull from and how many rows away you'd like to do the pull. LAG pulls from previous rows and LEAD pulls from following rows

*partition_defintion:* `PARTITION BY <expression>[{,<expression>...}]`

*order_definition:* `ORDER BY <expression> [ASC|DESC], [{,<expression>...}]`

*frame_definition:* `frame_unit {<frame_start>|<frame_between>}`

frame_start:

- `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING` frame starts at the first row of the partition.
- `N PRECEDING` a physical N of rows before the first current row. N can be a literal number or an expression that evaluates to a number.
- `CURRENT ROW` the row of the current calculation

frame_between: `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` (default)

- frame_start: as mentioned previously.
- `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` the frame ends at the final row in the partition.
- `N FOLLOWING` a physical N of rows after the current row.

5. Common Table Expression (CTE)
    ```
    WITH cte_name (column_list) AS (
        query
    ) 
    SELECT * FROM cte_name;
    ```
6. Date function

    - `DATEDIFF(date1, date2)` : difference of date1 - date2
    - `TIMESTAMPDIFF(FORMAT, date1, date2)`: difference of date2 - date1 in format: SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR, DAY, WEEK, MONTH, QUARTER, or YEAR.
    - `EXTRACT(unit FROM date)` : extract part of date

    ``` 
    mysql> SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM '2019-07-02');
        -> 2019
    mysql> SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM '2019-07-02 01:02:03');
        -> 201907
    mysql> SELECT EXTRACT(DAY_MINUTE FROM '2019-07-02 01:02:03');
        -> 20102
    mysql> SELECT EXTRACT(MICROSECOND FROM '2003-01-02 10:30:00.000123');
        -> 123
    ```
    - `DATE_FORMAT()` : returns a string with a character set
    ```
    mysql> SELECT DATE_FORMAT('2009-10-04 22:23:00', '%W %M %Y');
        -> 'Sunday October 2009'
    mysql> SELECT DATE_FORMAT('2007-10-04 22:23:00', '%H:%i:%s');
        -> '22:23:00'
    mysql> SELECT DATE_FORMAT('1900-10-04 22:23:00','%D %y %a %d %m %b %j');
        -> '4th 00 Thu 04 10 Oct 277'
    ```

7. CASE Statement

```
    CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE result
    END;
```
8. UPDATE

```
    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
    WHERE condition;
```
Could use CASE function as condition in SET
